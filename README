An EPP_ connection multiplexing proxy daemon.

It will be able to manage multiple connections to multiple downstream EPP
servers, while allowing connection sharing by clients to allow them to use a
single connection to talk to multiple downstream EPP servers.

It will also be bundled with a simpler reverse proxy to manage a connection to
a single downstream server.
